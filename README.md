# Weather-Trend-Analysis
Trend analysis  and comparison of global and local city temperatures over time.

In this project, we extract the annual average Global temperatures as well of Local Temperatures using SQL. We have data for more than 260 years to analyse. We then calculate 10 and 15 year moving averages in order to smooth out noisy spikes and to get a better idea about the overall trend.

We create a visualization to plot the above data and draw some insights from it. We calculate a few summary statistics so that the audience has a snapshot of all the important numbers and the trends in one place for quick reference.
